Mainly used PHP to grab all the directories/files in the lectures directory and then displayed them using a mix of bootstrap and custom css

For the challenges directory, I will only push the code in this repository once the challenge due date has past.
Also the links on the landing page for the challenges only redirect to the directory; so, there is no way to get the actual php file.
All this is to avoid a case of someone in the course finding this repo and copying the code as their own.
