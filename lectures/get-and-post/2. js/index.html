			With forms, GET data is encoded automatically, before it is sent. So if we construct our own URL in
			Javascript, we must make sure that data in encoded

			There are a number of illegal characters that would ruin our URL (;, &, /, ?, etc...)

			if we don't encode it, the & in "muA&M" would make this URL look like this: 
																		process.php?sid=mua&m
			what happens is:
				Make one key/value pair with
					'sid' = 'muA' and M = nothing
